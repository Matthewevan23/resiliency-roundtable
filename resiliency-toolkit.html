TASK: Generate 8-10 reflection questions that move from concrete → analytical → transfer. Help students discover that choosing your challenge level is itself an act of leadership, and that supporting from the ground is as important as doing the physical challenge.

CONSTRAINTS: Start with "what happened" questions to ground everyone. Build to questions about fear, trust, and leadership. End with transfer to their real lives. Use language that honors all participation levels - don't make climbers the heroes. Talking circle format, so questions should invite stories.`

TASK: Create metaphor-based reflection prompts that help students make meaning of what happened and see patterns they can transfer to future disagreements.

CONSTRAINTS: Don't ask "how did that feel" - they already know. Use metaphors to create distance and insight (weather, seasons, journeys, etc.). Help them see productive conflict vs. harmful conflict. End with commitments for future discussions. Keep it under 30 minutes. Use journaling or partner shares, not whole-group at first.`

CONSTRAINTS: Should take 15-20 minutes. Include at least 3 different movement activities. Build from simple to complex. End with a way to capture insights verbally or in writing. Make it feel playful but purposeful - not forced or cheesy.`

My students are diverse (Latinx, Asian American, Black, white) in Oakland, CA. I want to center indigenous agency, resistance, and survival.

TASK: Redesign this 2-week unit to center indigenous perspectives. Show indigenous peoples as strategic actors who shaped their own futures, not just victims. Include examples from multiple continents.

CONSTRAINTS: Don't erase the violence and oppression - acknowledge it - but don't make it the whole story. Use primary sources from indigenous voices when possible. Connect historical resistance to contemporary indigenous movements students might know. Make the through-line: "Colonialism happened, AND indigenous peoples resisted, survived, and continue to shape history."`

TASK: Generate a "text set" of 6-8 short pieces (articles, poems, short stories, spoken word videos) that represent my students' identities and create opportunities for cross-cultural learning.

CONSTRAINTS: Mix genres and formats. Include at least 2 pieces that specifically center immigrant/refugee experiences. Make sure there are texts where Jewish identity is present (I teach at a Jewish school). Texts should be accessible for 7th grade reading levels. Each text should be under 15 minutes to read/watch.`

TASK: Adapt this lesson to include indigenous/traditional knowledge systems alongside Western science. Show how different cultures have understood and worked with water cycles.

CONSTRAINTS: Don't treat indigenous knowledge as "cute folklore" - present it as legitimate science. Find ways both knowledge systems can inform each other. Include specific examples from at least 2 non-Western traditions. Keep the learning goal the same (understanding water cycles) but expand the sources of knowledge.`

This could get heated - we have students with strong opinions about cancel culture, accountability, and who gets second chances.

TASK: Generate 6-8 prompts for philosophical chairs that scaffold from easier to harder, force real moral reckoning, and make sure there are legitimate arguments on both sides.

CONSTRAINTS: Start with a simpler binary, build to more nuanced statements. Avoid prompts that just let kids virtue-signal. Use specific examples (Kanye, R. Kelly, J.K. Rowling, etc.) to make it concrete. Include prompts that make both sides uncomfortable. End with a prompt that moves beyond agree/disagree to complexity.`

CONSTRAINTS: Start by grounding everyone in what actually happens in the text. Build to harder questions about obedience, faith, parental responsibility, and God's character. Create space for students to struggle with the text - don't force resolution.

TASK: Design a 30-minute restorative circle for these two students (plus me as facilitator) that helps them understand impact, take responsibility, and rebuild some trust - without forcing fake reconciliation.

CONSTRAINTS: Start with grounding/centering activity. Use sentence stems and "I statements." Move through: what happened (facts), what I felt, what I needed, what I understand now, how I want to move forward. Give space for emotions but keep it from escalating again.

TASK: Create 4 versions of the same lesson for different learning styles: visual/spatial, kinesthetic/movement, verbal/linguistic, and logical/sequential. All paths should lead to the same understanding of theme.

CONSTRAINTS: Same learning goal (understand that theme is the deeper meaning/life lesson in a story). Same time limit (30 minutes). All versions should use the same short text (you pick an appropriate 7th grade story). Assessment should work across all versions.

CONSTRAINTS: All options should require research, analysis, and synthesis - not just creative expression. Options should include: something written, something visual/artistic, something performance-based, something tech/media-based, and something community-engaged. Rubric should work across all options.

TASK: Create a town hall structure for a 45-minute class where students can give meaningful input on homework policy, I can share my constraints, and we can co-create a solution.

CONSTRAINTS: I can't eliminate homework entirely (school policy). I need students to practice skills outside class. But I CAN adjust amount, format, deadlines, flexibility. The structure should include: setting the scope (what's on/off the table), gathering student input (not just complaints - actual ideas), my constraints/needs, collaborative problem-solving, and decision/next steps.

CONSTRAINTS: Include: plant blooming/dormancy, animal migration/behavior, weather patterns, and human cultural practices tied to seasons. Make it hyperlocal - specific to our schoolyard/neighborhood.
