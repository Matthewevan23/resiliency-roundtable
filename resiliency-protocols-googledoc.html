<h2>💬 PROTOCOL 1: REFLECTION PROMPTS - MOVING BEYOND "HOW DID THAT FEEL?"</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm a teen educator creating reflection prompts after an experiential activity.

<span class="section-label">THE EXPERIENCE:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What activity did students just do? Ex: "High ropes course where some climbed, some stopped halfway, some chose not to climb" or "Trust falls activity where students had to catch each other"]</span>

<span class="section-label">THE CORE INSIGHT I WANT THEM TO DISCOVER:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's the transferable learning? Ex: "Vulnerability comes before trust, not after" or "Choosing your challenge level is itself leadership"]</span>

<span class="section-label">WHAT FORMAT WORKS FOR THIS GROUP:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: How do they process best? Ex: "Talking circle - they're good at speaking" or "Partner journaling - they need think time first" or "Movement-based - they're kinesthetic learners"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Generate 8-10 reflection questions that move from concrete → analytical → philosophical/transfer. Start with "what happened" to ground everyone in shared experience. Build to questions that create productive cognitive dissonance. End with transfer to their real lives.

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Don't ask "how did that feel" - move beyond surface emotions. Use metaphor where helpful. Honor all participation levels (don't make people who "did more" the heroes). Questions should help students discover the insight, not tell them the answer.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> AI scaffolds the cognitive progression for you (concrete → abstract). You bring the knowledge of your students and the magic of facilitation. Students discover insights rather than being told them.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>🌟 PROTOCOL 2: CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CURRICULUM - CENTERING MARGINALIZED VOICES</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm a teacher adapting my curriculum to center diverse perspectives and counter-narratives.

<span class="section-label">THE LESSON I'M ADAPTING:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's the current lesson? Ex: "Unit on colonialism that's very Eurocentric" or "Civil Rights Movement unit that only covers MLK and Rosa Parks"]</span>

<span class="section-label">WHAT'S MISSING:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: Whose voices/perspectives are left out? Ex: "Indigenous resistance and agency" or "Local activists from our city" or "Stories that connect to my students' families' experiences"]</span>

<span class="section-label">MY STUDENTS' IDENTITIES:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: Who are your students? Ex: "Mostly Latinx and Asian American in Oakland" or "Mixed race, immigrant, and refugee backgrounds"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Redesign this lesson/unit to center the perspectives I identified as missing. Show people as strategic actors who shaped their own futures, not just victims or passive recipients of history. Help students see themselves in the content AND learn about experiences different from their own.

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Don't erase oppression and violence - acknowledge it - but don't make it the whole story. Use primary sources from the voices/communities you're centering when possible. Connect historical content to contemporary movements or issues. Keep the core learning goals but expand the sources of knowledge.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> AI can find examples, sources, and connections you might not know. But YOU know your students, your community, and what matters. This protocol centers both.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>💭 PROTOCOL 3: SOCRATIC SEMINAR - SCAFFOLDED QUESTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm designing a Socratic seminar for my students.

<span class="section-label">THE TEXT WE'RE DISCUSSING:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What text? Include title and brief description. Ex: "First three chapters of Night by Elie Wiesel" or "The Binding of Isaac (Akeidah)" or "Ta-Nehisi Coates' 'Between the World and Me'"]</span>

<span class="section-label">MY STUDENTS:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: Age/grade and any relevant context. Ex: "8th graders, this is their first Holocaust text" or "11th graders with varying comfort discussing race"]</span>

<span class="section-label">WHAT MAKES THIS TEXT COMPLEX OR SENSITIVE:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's tricky here? Ex: "Some students have family Holocaust connections, others learning about it first time" or "This text could create tension between students with different identities/experiences"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Generate 10-12 Socratic seminar questions that move from concrete/text-based → analytical/interpretive → philosophical/ethical → personal meaning/transfer.

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Start by grounding everyone in what the text actually says (quotes, facts, events). Build to harder questions about meaning, implications, and connections. Create productive tension but honor students' identities and experiences. Mix targeted questions (specific answers) with open questions (multiple valid responses). Help students sit with complexity - don't force easy resolution.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The scaffolding keeps everyone engaged - struggling readers can access early questions, advanced readers are challenged by later ones. The text-specificity means you get questions ready to use, not generic prompts.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>🎨 PROTOCOL 4: DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION - SAME CONCEPT, MULTIPLE PATHWAYS</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm creating multiple versions of the same lesson for different learning styles and needs.

<span class="section-label">THE CONCEPT/SKILL I'M TEACHING:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's the learning goal? Ex: "Understanding theme in literature" or "Photosynthesis process" or "Solving for X in algebra"]</span>

<span class="section-label">MY STUDENTS' LEARNING NEEDS:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What learning differences? Ex: "ADHD, dyslexia, autism, anxiety, different processing speeds" or "English learners at different levels"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TIME LIMIT:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: How long? Ex: "30 minutes" or "One 50-minute class"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Create 4 versions of this lesson for different learning styles: visual/spatial, kinesthetic/movement, verbal/linguistic, and logical/sequential. All versions should lead to the same understanding and meet the same learning goal.

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Same rigor across all versions - different doesn't mean easier. Same assessment can work for all versions. Students should be able to choose which pathway works for them. Make sure neurodiverse students aren't getting watered-down content - it's different paths to the same destination.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> AI generates the multiple versions quickly. You know your students and can assign pathways strategically or let them choose. Everyone gets to their zone of proximal development through their best modality.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>🗳️ PROTOCOL 5: CO-DESIGN WITH STUDENTS - AUTHENTIC SHARED DECISION-MAKING</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm designing a process for students to have real input on classroom decisions.

<span class="section-label">WHAT STUDENTS WILL HAVE INPUT ON:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's on the table? Ex: "Classroom norms and expectations" or "Homework policy" or "How we assess their learning"]</span>

<span class="section-label">MY NON-NEGOTIABLES:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What can't change? Ex: "Safety and respect are required" or "Students must demonstrate mastery of the standards" or "I can't eliminate homework entirely - school policy"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TIME I HAVE:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: How long? Ex: "One 50-minute class" or "Two class periods" or "30 minutes at the start of year"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Design a co-creation process that gives students authentic voice and power to shape this decision, within the constraints I've named. This should feel like real shared power, not performative "we'll consider your input."

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Make sure quieter students have voice, not just loud ones. Include: me naming non-negotiables upfront, structured ideation/brainstorming, small group synthesis, whole-class decision-making, and a way to document and revisit what we decide. End with commitments everyone can live with. Build in accountability - how will we know if this is working?
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Students see their voice actually changing what happens. You maintain necessary boundaries while genuinely sharing power. Co-created solutions have better buy-in than top-down rules.</p>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>🌲 PROTOCOL 6: PLACE-BASED LEARNING - SITE-SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES</h2>

<p><strong>Copy everything in the box below. Fill in the RED parts first, then paste into AI.</strong></p>

<div class="protocol-box">
I'm designing place-based learning experiences for a specific location.

<span class="section-label">THE PLACE:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: Describe the site. Ex: "Urban creek that runs through park in our neighborhood" or "The woods behind our school" or "Downtown historic district"]</span>

<span class="section-label">UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS PLACE:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: What's special about this location? Ex: "Has native plants and invasive species side by side" or "Site of indigenous settlement" or "Watershed for our drinking water"]</span>

<span class="section-label">MY STUDENTS:</span>
<span class="red-text">[Write here: Age and any relevant context. Ex: "8th graders studying ecosystems" or "10th graders in environmental justice unit"]</span>

<span class="section-label">TASK:</span> Generate 8-10 learning experiences unique to this place that help students develop "sense of place" - connecting ecological knowledge, cultural/historical knowledge, and personal meaning-making.

<span class="section-label">CONSTRAINTS:</span> Mix ecological observation, cultural/historical investigation, and personal connection. Include at least one activity that connects to indigenous history of this place. Include at least one activity where students interact with community members (neighbors, elders, park staff). Some activities should be solo, some partner, some group. Some scientific, some artistic, some reflective. Students should create something that shows their connection to place.
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Instead of generic "observe nature" worksheets, you get activities specific to YOUR place. Students learn that every place has layers of meaning - ecological, cultural, personal - worth paying attention to.</p>
</div>

<h2>💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS</h2>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>For Educators:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The messier your notes, the more AI helps! Don't overthink it.</li>
    <li>Always read and personalize the output before using it.</li>
    <li>If AI's output feels off, ask it to revise: "Make this more age-appropriate" or "Add more specific examples"</li>
    <li>Save your favorite outputs - they become examples you can refine over time</li>
    <li>Share what works with your colleagues!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>For Program Leaders:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make a copy of this document for your organization</li>
    <li>Customize the protocols to match your pedagogical approach</li>
    <li>Add new protocols using the same format</li>
    <li>Share with your educators (give them "view" access so they can copy from it)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<hr class="divider">

<h2>🎯 REMEMBER</h2>

<div class="tip-box">
<ul>
    <li>The goal isn't to save time - it's to <strong>remove the barrier</strong> between your brilliant pedagogical thinking and actually implementing it</li>
    <li>You have deep knowledge of your students, your content, and your values - AI can't replace that</li>
    <li>AI handles the grunt work (generating variations, scaffolding questions, finding examples) so you can focus on what matters: facilitation, relationship, and presence</li>
    <li>When the mechanical parts are easier, you have more energy for the <strong>magic</strong></li>
    <li>YOUR expertise is irreplaceable - AI just makes it easier to scale your best thinking</li>
</ul>
